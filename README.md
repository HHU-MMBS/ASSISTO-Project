## 1. Data Preparation

Let's start by preparing data. 

By runing [`datapreparation/data_alignment.py`](https://github.com/rahilgholami/ASSISTO-Project/blob/main/datapreparation/data_alignment.py), we perform a crucial data alignment process that synchronizes the time series with real daytime and efficiently divides them into one-hour intervals. This data alignment step ensures that the time series data is organized consistently, enabling easier and more accurate analysis and interpretation.

To read the data and split them to training and test sets, run the following code, `datapreparation/train_test_split.ipynb`,
which generates following files in format `.pickle`.
```
train_set.pickle
test_set.pickle
ood_set.pickle
```


## 2. Training

To train self-supervised model, run this command:
```train
python train.py --epochs 500 --batch_size 128 --lr 0.001 --hdim 128 --input_channel 512 --temperature 0.07 --window_size 1000
```

## 3. Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model, run this command:
```evaluation
python evaluation.py --model_path <path to checkpoint> --data_path <path to data>
```
